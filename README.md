## 🧐 What is this?

**ATM** is a high-end thrift marketplace designed to bring the "treasure hunt" experience of physical thrift shops into a sleek, digital environment. It combines the ease of modern e-commerce with the curated, unique nature of vintage shopping.

## 💡 Why did we build it?

Physical thrift stores in India are often unorganized or localized to specific markets. We built ATM to:
- **Democratize Thrift**: Provide a centralized, high-quality platform for pre-loved fashion.
- **Modernize the Experience**: Replace clunky listings with a smooth, social-media-style "Fresh Finds" feed.
- **Promote Sustainability**: Make sustainable fashion the "cool" and easy choice for the modern Indian consumer.

## 🚀 What problem does it solve?

Most marketplaces treat thrifted items like second-hand junk. ATM solves this by:
1. **Quality Perception**: Using a "glassmorphism" premium UI to elevate the perception of pre-owned items.
2. **Browsing Fatigue**: Implementing **Infinite Scroll** and **Intelligent Search** to make discovery effortless.
3. **Trust**: Providing a verified, curated look and feel that builds confidence in sustainable shopping.
