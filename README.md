# My Local Mall

**My Local Mall** is a hyper-local, community-driven e-commerce platform that brings the neighborhood shopping experience into the digital era. It allows any user to create their own professional shop and provides customers with a seamless way to shop across multiple vendors with integrated local delivery.

## 🧐 What is this?

**My Local Mall** is more than just a marketplace; it's a digital twin of your local neighborhood. We empower local businesses and individual entrepreneurs to set up digital storefronts, making neighborhood commerce accessible, efficient, and modern.

## 💡 Why did we build it?

Local commerce in India is vibrant but often lacks the convenience of major e-commerce players. We built My Local Mall to:
- **Democratize Retail**: Allow anyone to create a professional shop in minutes.
- **Support Hyper-local**: Connect customers directly with shops in their own vicinity.
- **Simplify Logistics**: Offer an integrated delivery service that handles the "last mile" for local vendors.

## 🚀 What problem does it solve?

1. **Accessibility**: Discover hidden gems in your neighborhood that aren't on big platforms.
2. **Convenience**: Add items from multiple local shops to one cart and receive them in a single delivery.
3. **Speed**: Integrated local delivery means faster turnaround than national courier services.
